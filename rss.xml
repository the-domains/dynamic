            <description><![CDATA[<p>After college, I thought about what subject that *I* most wanted to learn about.  It had to be something that would serve me well my entire life and would benefit others in my life too.  I thought about being a pro in a sport or activity, I contemplated being an expert on the stock market, and I considered esthetician school so I could have gorgeous skin, (hey, it was right after college... what can I say?)  All of these seemed either temporary, self-serving, or lacked depth.  </p>]]></description>
